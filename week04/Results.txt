Notes (what the above indicates):
Seach using L and A method are quite inefficient as their algorithm is rather similar to those of linked list.

Prefix insert does not have high cost as the reuslting tree is balanced. Similarly, random order insert usually reuslts in a self-balanced tree, thus, the low cost.

B, insert at leaves, but periodically rebalance the tree, ensures balaced tree, making search less costly, compared to the L and A methods.

Sprey tree ensures that the newly inserted node is always the root making search less cosly.

AVL tree is self-balaced, thus, making it the most efficient way of searching O(log2 n).
